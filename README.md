DO NOT FORGET TO RUN THE SPRINGBOOT APPLICATION BEFORE RUNNING THIS PROJECT.
KINDLY NAVIGATE TO GITHUB: https://github.com/oluway/graphql-api-backend





# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. I used [npm](https://npm.com) to manage the dependencies, you can install node from [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
